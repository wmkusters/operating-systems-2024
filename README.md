# MIT 6.1810 Operating Systems Self-Study
This repo contains my work against the MIT Operating System Engineering course. 
The class website can be found [at CSAIL's webiste](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/index.html). 
Click the `Labs` dropdown to access [the tools page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/tools.html), which has 
some tool requirements and installation instructions for the class. 
The [first lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/util.html) has some
additional setup instructions. 
## Course Structure
The course constitutes of adding incremental changes to [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf), a toy operating system used to teach classes like this. These changes are bundled into "labs". Each lab is contained in a different branch of the repo, such as `util`, `syscall`, etc.

The original README is copied in full here:

```
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
